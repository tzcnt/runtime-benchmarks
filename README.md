- Processor: EPYC 7742 64-core processor
- Worker Thread Count: 64 (no SMT)
- OS: Debian 13 Server
- Compiler: Clang 19.1.6 Release (-O3 -march=native)
- CPU boost enabled / schedutil governor
- Linked against libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4

### What's covered?
Currently only includes C++ frameworks, and several recursive fork-join benchmarks:
- recursive fibonacci (forks x2)
- skynet ([original link](https://github.com/atemerev/skynet)) but increased to 100M tasks (forks x10)
- nqueens (forks up to x14)
- matmul (forks x4)

Benchmark problem sizes were chosen to balance between making the total runtime of a full sweep tolerable (especially on weaker hardware with slower runtimes), and being sufficiently large to show meaningful differentiation between faster runtimes.

### How to build and run the benchmarks yourself
Install Dependencies:
- The bench script uses python3
- CMake + Clang 18 or newer (GCC is supported but you'll need to edit the script to use it)
- libfork and TooManyCooks depend on the [hwloc](https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/) library.
- TBB benchmarks depend on system installed TBB - see the [installation guide here for the newest version](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/installation-guide-linux/2024-2/apt.html) or you may be able to find the old version 'libtbb-dev' in your system package manager
- A high performance allocator (tcmalloc, jemalloc, or mimalloc) is also recommended. The build script will dynamically link to any of these if they are available.

`apt-get install cmake libhwloc-dev intel-oneapi-tbb-devel libtcmalloc-minimal4`

Quick Results (uses threads = #CPUs):

`python3 ./build_and_bench_all.py`

Results will appear in `RESULTS.md` and `RESULTS.csv` files.

Full Results (sweeps threads from 1 to #CPUs):

`python3 ./build_and_bench_all.py full`

Results will appear in `RESULTS.json` file; this file can be parsed by the interactive benchmarks site.

Frameworks to come:
- (C#) .Net thread pool
- (Rust) [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)
- (Golang) goroutines
- Facebook Folly
- PhotonLibOS https://github.com/alibaba/PhotonLibOS
